## Overview

The TO-DO List Application is a fully functional, client-side project developed with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It provides a seamless user experience for managing to-do lists without the need for a backend server, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

1. **Main Interface:** A clean dashboard with an input field for adding new tasks, a dynamic list displaying existing tasks, and action buttons for each item.
2. **Core Sections:** 
   * **Header:** Simple title and optional search or filter bar.
   * **Task Input Area:** Form to add new tasks with a submit button.
   * **Task List:** Interactive list where tasks appear with completion status (checkbox), and controls (edit/delete icons).
   * **Footer:** Optional summary of completed/pending tasks or clear all button.
3. **Data Management:** Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage to persist across sessions.

## Features

* Add Tasks: Quickly add new tasks via an input form with real-time validation.
